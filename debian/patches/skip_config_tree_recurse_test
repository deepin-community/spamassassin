Description: Skip config_tree_recurse test

 The default behavior of File::Find will automatically untaint directories with
 "safe" names.  The '~' (tilde) character is not considered a safe name.
 Because Debian source package names use '~' to denote pre-release versions, the
 test will fail with a message similar to the following:
 .
 t/config_tree_recurse.t ........... _get_cf_pre_files_in_dir error: directory /home/admin/spamassassin-3.4.3~rc6+1/t/log/localrules.tmp is still tainted at /usr/share/perl/5.30/File/Find.pm line 558. at ../lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm line 2096.
 .
 The solution to this is either to modify lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm to consider
 '~' a safe character, or skip the test altogether.  Because the former would
 impact all installations, and the latter is limited to test coverage, we will
 skip the test.
